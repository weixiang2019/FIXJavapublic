Hi Luz, 

Have you received all payment from ICBC yet?
I received $8000+$4070 on July 31st.  thank you. May I know how much the balance left in my account?

In addition,  do you happen to know if our company CEM participated in New York State Paid Family Leave?


Thanks

Wei,
 
I reviewed our invoices and payments, and ICBC FS has not paid any of our invoices since you started working there. We have invoices for March, April, May and June, all pending. The June invoice includes regular time, overtime and the Lyft.

ICBC said CEM must submitted invoice to them regarding Lyft reimbursement. If you already did. Then should be paid. 
 
Attached is my lyft approval in case you need it. 
 
 
 
Thanks

I’m not sure in detail, I only know that you will get more money in your 1099.
I also don’t know if the Lyft invoice has been paid by the client. If they did, you will be reimbursed.

Good morning, Luz, 
 
I have submitted approved overtime timesheet and reimbursed Lyft receipt for June as below, however haven’t received any payment from CEM regarding this,  can you please check?
 
Also, ICBC told me they approved CEM invoice 1 week ago, they should already send payment to CEM, have you received any payment for my timesheet and overtime timesheet. 
If not, I can ask ICBC accountant again.
 
Please advise, Thank you
 
Thanks
